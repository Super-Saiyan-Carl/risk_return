Repository for the 4th weekly challenge in my fintech course

Step 1: Import the Data
  Imported data for the 4 funds and sp500
  
Step 2: Analyze the Performance
  Reviewed cumulative return data for the funds and sp500
  
Step 3: Analyze the Volatility
  Box plot vizualizations for the four funds
  
Step 4: Analyze the Risk
  Charted the standard deviation for the four funds
  
Step 5: Analyze the Risk Return Profile
  Looked at sharpe ratio for each of the four funds vs sp500

Step 6: Diversify the Portfolio
  Compared 60 day variance, covariance, and beta of berkshire hathaway and tiger global mgmt

Overall, this section was pretty easy as it focused more on calculations than programming intricices.  After review of the 4 funds vs the S&P 500, Berkshire Hathaway is the fund I would include in the company's offering.
