Repository for the 4th weekly challenge in my fintech course

Step 2: Analyze the Performance--
  Reviewed cumulative return data for the funds and sp500
  
Step 3: Analyze the Volatility--
  Box plot vizualizations for the four funds
  
Step 4: Analyze the Risk--
  Charted the standard deviation for the four funds
  
Step 5: Analyze the Risk Return Profile--
  Looked at sharpe ratio for each of the four funds vs sp500

Step 6: Diversify the Portfolio--
  Compared 60 day variance, covariance, and beta of berkshire hathaway and tiger global mgmt

--Overall, this section was pretty easy as it focused more on calculations than programming intricices.  After review of the 4 funds vs the S&P 500, Berkshire Hathaway is the fund I would include in the company's offering.
